# MiniDNS

This is a tiny DNS server that I wrote to understand DNS better.
It is in no way and will never be production ready, but it can answer DNS queries (even compressed ones).
Implementing it taught me about [Chaosnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaosnet) and other ancient computing technology.
